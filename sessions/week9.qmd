## Introduction

This week will introduce Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and how to move from notebooks to scripts. It will also introduce best practices for coding in Python notebooks such as using sklearn pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand the procedure of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
2. Understand the motivation of moving from notebooks to scripts.
3. Appreciate best practices for coding in Python notebooks and using sklearn pipelines.

## Practical

:::{.callout-note}

To save a copy of notebook to your own GitHub Repo: follow the GitHub link, click on `Raw` and then `Save File As...` to save it to your own computer. Make sure to change the extension from `.ipynb.txt` (which will probably be the default) to `.ipynb`before adding the file to *your* GitHub repository.
