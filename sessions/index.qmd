## Objectives
1. Get an overview of (geospatial) machine learning.
2. Understand framework and key methods of supervised learning.
3. Can apply supervised learning to real-world problems with various data types (tabular, image, network)

## Why study this module?
- AI can make mistakes; understanding how it works is crucial.
- Achieving a balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability is important.
- Spatial is special: spatial data have unique characteristics that require special treatment.

## Prerequisites
- Can understand/follow Python code and run Jupyter notebooks.
- Basic knowledge of statistics (mean, variance, correlation, probability) and linear regression.

## Course Structure
- Lectures: 10 weeks (Wednesdays 9:00–10:30).
- Tutorials: 10 weeks (Wednesdays 10:30–12:00).

## Platforms
- **Email** for important notices and private questions.
- **Github & website** for lecture notes and notebooks.
- **Moodle** for lectures recording and assessments.
- **Slack** for public questions.
