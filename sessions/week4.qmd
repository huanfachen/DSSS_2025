## Introduction

This week will introduce tree-based methods for supervised learning, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand the design and training of decision trees.
2. Understand the principle of ensemble methods, including bagging and boosting.
3. Understand the design and strengths of random forests and gradient boosting machines.
4. Can apply tree-based methods from proper libraries (random forest from `sklearn` and XGBoot from `XGBoost`).

## Practical

:::{.callout-note}

To save a copy of notebook to your own GitHub Repo: follow the GitHub link, click on `Raw` and then `Save File As...` to save it to your own computer. Make sure to change the extension from `.ipynb.txt` (which will probably be the default) to `.ipynb`before adding the file to *your* GitHub repository.
