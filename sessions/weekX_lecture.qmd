# This week 

## Understanding and describing data 

- Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analysing **numerical data** to describe, model, and predict variables of interest.

- Garbage in, garbage out.

::: {.notes}
This lecture focuses on understanding and describing data. 

:::

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture you should:

1. Understand basic data types;
2. Consider how to summarise and represent data.

# Overview 
We've covered: 

- Data types: levels of measurements; quantitative & qualitative
- Key metrics 
- Null values and outliers
- Visualising data

# A big table

| Feature                  | CPU                                   | GPU                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Architecture             | Few cores optimised for sequential tasks | Thousands of cores for parallel processing |
| Memory                   | Larger cache size, less memory bandwidth | Higher memory bandwidth, less cache size |
| Power Consumption        | Generally lower power consumption     | Higher power consumption due to many cores |
| Use Cases                | General-purpose computing, complex logic | Graphics rendering, deep learning, scientific simulations |
| Cost                     | Less expensive              | Expensive |
| Programming Complexity    | Easier to program for general tasks   | Requires knowledge of parallel programming (e.g., CUDA) |

# Practical 
Practical will focus on setting up Python environment and describing a dataset.

- Have questions prepared!
