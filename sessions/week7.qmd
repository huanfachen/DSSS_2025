## Introduction

This week, we’ll explore how to interpret a trained machine learning models and how to select features for training a machine learning model.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand different model interpretation techniques.
2. Understand methods for selecting features in machine learning.

## Lecture 

To access the lecture notes: [Lecture](W07_model_interpretation_feature_selection/model_interpretation_feature_selection.qmd)

## Quiz

To access the quiz on Moodle, please check [Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=53572).

## Practical
