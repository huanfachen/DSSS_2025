## Introduction

This week, we’ll explore how to generalise neural networks to graph-structured data and introduce the classic types of graph neural networks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand the design and training of graph neural networks.
2. Understand the common types of graph neural networks.
3. Can apply graph neural networks to real-world graph-structured data.

## Lecture 

To access the lecture notes: [Lecture](W06_graph_neural_networks/graph_neural_networks.qmd)

## Quiz

To access the quiz on Moodle, please check [Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=53572).

## Practical

:::{.callout-note}

To save a copy of notebook to your own GitHub Repo: follow the GitHub link, click on `Raw` and then `Save File As...` to save it to your own computer. Make sure to change the extension from `.ipynb.txt` (which will probably be the default) to `.ipynb`before adding the file to *your* GitHub repository.
