For example, the Area_type variable can be encoded for convenience as 0 (“national”), 1 (“country”), and 2 (“local authority”). Although these are stored as numbers, Area_type is not truly numeric data — it’s an nominal variable.\n\n\nDoes it make sense to say ‘The population of LA AAA is twice of LA BBB’? Yes. So, this variable is of ratio type.\n\nmax and min\nWhat is the maximum population size in census 2021?\nprint(\"Max population: \", df_pop_la['Population_2021'].max(skipna=True))\nWhich LAs have the maximum population size? The code above is a bit complicated.\n\nprint(\"{} have the maximum population of {}\".format(\n    \", \".join(df_pop_la.loc[df_pop_la['Population_2021'] == df_pop_la['Population_2021'].max(skipna=True), 'Area_name']), \n    df_pop_la['Population_2021'].max(skipna=True))\n    )\n\nKent have the maximum population of 1576069.0\n\n\nWhat it does: - Finds the max population while ignoring NaNs. - Selects all rows with that population. - Joins their Area_name values into a comma-separated string.\nTwo new Python functions here: - format(): Inserts variables into a string by replacing {} placeholders in order with provided arguments. - join(): Combines the elements of an iterable into one string using the given separator before .join().\nWhich LAs have the minimum population?\n\nprint(\"{} have the minimum population of {}\".format(\n    \", \".join(df_pop_la.loc[df_pop_la['Population_2021'] == df_pop_la['Population_2021'].min(skipna=True), 'Area_name']), \n    df_pop_la['Population_2021'].min(skipna=True))\n    )\n\nIsles of Scilly have the minimum population of 2054.0\n\n\n\n\nNA value and outliers?\nAre there NA values or outliers in this variable? From results of info(), there are no NA values.\nTo detect outliers, we will implement the Tukey Fences method using pandas function, as pandas does not provide a built-in function for this method.\n\n# Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR\nQ1 = df_pop_la['Population_2021'].quantile(0.25)\nQ3 = df_pop_la['Population_2021'].quantile(0.75)\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n\n# Tukey's fences\nlower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\nupper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n\n# Detect outliers\noutliers = df_pop_la[\n    (df_pop_la['Population_2021'] &lt; lower_bound) |\n    (df_pop_la['Population_2021'] &gt; upper_bound)\n]\n\nprint(\"Lower bound:\", lower_bound)\nprint(\"Upper bound:\", upper_bound)\nprint(\"How many outliers?\", outliers.shape[0])\nprint(\"Outliers:\\n\", outliers)\n\nLower bound: -130408.0\nUpper bound: 498868.0\nHow many outliers? 33\nOutliers:\n      Area_code        Area_name        Area_type  Population_2011  \\\n56   E06000047    County Durham  Local Authority         513242.0   \n60   E06000052         Cornwall  Local Authority         532273.0   \n62   E06000054        Wiltshire  Local Authority         470981.0   \n68   E06000060  Buckinghamshire  Local Authority         505283.0   \n254  E08000003       Manchester  Local Authority         503127.0   \n270  E08000019        Sheffield  Local Authority         552698.0   \n275  E08000025       Birmingham  Local Authority        1073045.0   \n282  E08000032         Bradford  Local Authority         522452.0   \n285  E08000035            Leeds  Local Authority         751485.0   \n321  E10000003   Cambridgeshire  Local Authority         621210.0   \n322  E10000006          Cumbria  Local Authority         499858.0   \n323  E10000007       Derbyshire  Local Authority         769686.0   \n324  E10000008            Devon  Local Authority         746399.0   \n325  E10000011      East Sussex  Local Authority         526671.0   \n326  E10000012            Essex  Local Authority        1393587.0   \n327  E10000013  Gloucestershire  Local Authority         596984.0   \n328  E10000014        Hampshire  Local Authority        1317788.0   \n329  E10000015    Hertfordshire  Local Authority        1116062.0   \n330  E10000016             Kent  Local Authority        1463740.0   \n331  E10000017       Lancashire  Local Authority        1171339.0   \n332  E10000018   Leicestershire  Local Authority         650489.0   \n333  E10000019     Lincolnshire  Local Authority         713653.0   \n334  E10000020          Norfolk  Local Authority         857888.0   \n335  E10000023  North Yorkshire  Local Authority         598376.0   \n336  E10000024  Nottinghamshire  Local Authority         785802.0   \n337  E10000025      Oxfordshire  Local Authority         653798.0   \n338  E10000027         Somerset  Local Authority         529972.0   \n339  E10000028    Staffordshire  Local Authority         848489.0   \n340  E10000029          Suffolk  Local Authority         728163.0   \n341  E10000030           Surrey  Local Authority        1132390.0   \n342  E10000031     Warwickshire  Local Authority         545474.0   \n343  E10000032      West Sussex  Local Authority         806892.0   \n344  E10000034   Worcestershire  Local Authority         566169.0   \n\n     Population_2021  Percentage_change  \n56          522068.0                1.7  \n60          570305.0                7.1  \n62          510330.0                8.4  \n68          553078.0                9.5  \n254         551938.0                9.7  \n270         556521.0                0.7  \n275        1144919.0                6.7  \n282         546412.0                4.6  \n285         811953.0                8.0  \n321         678849.0                9.3  \n322         499846.0                0.0  \n323         794636.0                3.2  \n324         811640.0                8.7  \n325         545847.0                3.6  \n326        1503521.0                7.9  \n327         645076.0                8.1  \n328        1400899.0                6.3  \n329        1198798.0                7.4  \n330        1576069.0                7.7  \n331        1235354.0                5.5  \n332         712366.0                9.5  \n333         768364.0                7.7  \n334         916120.0                6.8  \n335         615491.0                2.9  \n336         824822.0                5.0  \n337         725291.0               10.9  \n338         571547.0                7.8  \n339         876104.0                3.3  \n340         760688.0                4.5  \n341        1203108.0                6.2  \n342         596773.0                9.4  \n343         882676.0                9.4  \n344         603676.0                6.6  \n\n\nThere are 33 outliers in this dataset.

For each number of neighbors that we want to try, we build a model on the training set, and evaluate it on the validation set. We then pick the best validation set score, here that’s 99.1%, achieved when using 11 neighbors. We then retrain the model with this parameter, and evaluate on the test set. The retraining step is somewhat optional. We could also just use the best model. But retraining allows us to make better use of all the data.\nStill, our results depend on how exactly we split the datasets. So how can we make this more robust?"

The retraining step is somewhat optional. We could also just use the best model.

You should also review the full bibliography while developing your thinking for the final project.\nUse Google or Stack Overflow–as you become a better programmer you’ll start to understand how to frame your question in ways that produce the right answer right away, but whether you’re a beginner or an expert Stack Overflow is your friend.\nSign up for online classes–there are lots of plausible online classes on LinkedIn course or Coursera. Please check the reviews before you take an online module."

    "section": "Assessment Aims",
    "text": "Assessment Aims\nThis assessment is designed to test your understanding of the quantitative methods introduced in this course, but also, crucially, your ability to really understand how, if used correctly and applied to appropriate data, these methods can help you tell a powerful story and be the underpinning evidence-base for a relevant local, national or international issue.\nUsing quantitative methods to contribute to public debates is vital if students, academics and universities are to demonstrate our value to the wider world. We don’t want you to just apply a method and regurgitate unintelligible coefficients. Quantitative methods can only have real value if they are used to support wider debates in ways that everyone should be able to understand.\nWe are not testing your coding abilities – you may use either of the main coding languages taught this term (R or Python). We are not testing your ability to write a standard piece of academic writing. But we are testing your ability to use quantitative methods appropriately and with a clear connection between the data, methods and outputs, to help others understand a particular issue through a data lens.\n\nPart 1 - Article\nYour task is to write a short 800-1000-word piece of ‘public-facing scholarly writing’ in the style of an article that that could appear in The Conversation or the Financial Times in their data section. This piece could relate to a local, national or international topic which could be either serious or frivolous but must employ appropriate quantitative methods learned in this course to derive novel insights from a particular dataset (or range of datasets) associated with a particular topic of your choosing. Data analysis and the use of quantitative methods should be central to your piece, but outputs must be appropriate for a general (non-academic) audience with your piece illuminated by appropriate visual outputs – maps, graphs or other data visualisations. Your piece should contain a range of graphical or tabular elements.\n\n\nPart 2 - Technical Appendix\nYour 800-1000-word article should be accompanied by a max 1000-word technical appendix detailing the analysis you have carried out behind the scenes to allow you to make the observations you have in your article. Here you might want to include additional exploratory visualisations, tabular outputs, interpretations of those outputs, equations etc. and you could also include any observations about the dataset or the validity / statistical significance of any models you employ. The purpose of the appendix is to reassure anyone who wants to delve deeper, that the observations you made in your main article are valid and reliable and your interpretations valid.\n\n\nTopic\nYour topic can be anything you like broadly related to human, urban or social issues, as long as you can find some suitable data to analyse. For inspiration on relevant topics, you might want to review some of the articles that John Burn-Murdoch has written for the Financial Times in recent years - https://www.ft.com/john-burn-murdoch (you can log-in via your UCL credentials) or some of the pieces in the Conversation - https://theconversation.com/.\nIf you are struggling for inspiration, you are welcome to explore an educational topic using DfE schools data used in class, but you are encouraged to be creative in your data choices (as you are being partially marked on your originality), and you should not repeat analyses carried out on variables in any of the practical sessions. The only topic we will not permit in this assessment is anything related to AirBnB as this is the focus of CASA0013.\n\n\nArticle Content\nYou will note that most of John Burn-Murdoch’s articles generally contain the sorts of analyses we would describe as exploratory. While your article should contain basic exploratory analysis in the form of visualisations, you should also use an appropriate method from the second half of the course (lectures 5-10) related to either more sophisticated exploratory analysis like multivariate statistical analysis (e.g. dimensionality reduction or cluster analysis) or some explanatory / predictive methods such as ANOVA, linear regression or some of the generalised linear models also introduced.\n\n\nStyle of Briefing\nYou should write in plain English and avoid the use of jargon or technical language. For tips on how to write in this style, The Conversation has produced a guide: https://socsci.web.ox.ac.uk/files/conversation-writing-public-why-and-how\n\n\nTypes of Data Permissible and Sources\nAnything you like, but you should choose carefully so that you are able to demonstrate the appropriate skills. There are many potential sources of data – these could be linked from FT or Conversation articles, or you could try sites like:\nhttps://data.gov/\nhttps://www.data.gov.uk/\nhttps://opendata.nhsbsa.net/\nhttps://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/  \nhttps://data.europa.eu/data/datasets?locale=en\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/\nhttps://data.london.gov.uk/\nYou can probably find many more!\n\n\nReferencing\nWe will not expect standard academic referencing in this piece, however, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t include references – you should. In this style of public facing scholarly writing, it is common to use hyperlinks and footnotes and you should make use of these to support your narrative.\n\n\nFormat of the Piece\nExamples – Here is just one example of the kind of article you might produce (minus the technical appendix), but read widely around the data journalism sites linked from publications like the Financial Times, New York Times, Guardian.\nhttps://theconversation.com/constituency-level-data-reveals-which-parties-are-most-threatened-by-reform-264422\n\n\nDeadline and Handing In\nThe Deadline for the assessment is Monday, 27 April 2026 @ 10:00.\nYour report and technical appendix should be uploaded to Moodle as a single PDF document.",

    "text": "The Data Science for Spatial Systems (DSSS) module is a optional element of CASA’s MSc/MRes USS Course and is intended provide an introduction to advanced computational techniques in spatial analysis, or advanced spatial data sicence.\nAs with most computational analysis, spatial data science builds on two pillars: methods and data. In recent year, as AI (represented by deep learning and large-language models) has developed rapidly, numerous efficient techniques have been invented and open-sourced, which enables integration of heterougenous data. For example, we are now able to combine census data, remote sensing data, street-view imagery, and text data for understanding urban security or urban heat island effect on an ordnary laptop. Notably, (geospatial) foundation models, which are large, pre-trained AI models, are expected to become versatile bases for many specific tasks. It seems like we could model and predict almost everything in spatial analysis, even if we don’t understand what foundation models are doing. However, this is not entirely true. So far, AI is not silver bullet and AI has halluciations. We need to understand the principle and limitations of various computational models; we need to be critical about methods and results; we need to ask critical questions for any task; and we need to link modelling with applications so as to inform policy and practice.\nThe module is structured progressively across three core sections. The first section introduces supervised machine learning and their applications. We will firstly introduce the principle and workflow of supervised machine learning, and then talk about tree-based methods and neural networks….\nFollowing TBC\nThe second section builds upon this foundation to explore the core of statistical modelling: understanding and quantifying relationships between variables. Students will progress from measuring correlations to building sophisticated regression models. The curriculum covers the workhorse of social science, the Generalised Linear Model (GLM), before advancing to Multilevel Models, a critical technique for handling the nested and hierarchical data that is common in geographical and social research.\nThe final section of the course introduces advanced techniques for uncovering hidden structures within complex, high-dimensional datasets. Students will learn methods for dimensionality reduction to simplify complexity without losing vital information, and clustering analysis to identify natural groupings and patterns in data.\nTherefore, this module guides students on a complete analytical journey, from foundational principles to the application of advanced modelling techniques. It serves as a vital prerequisite for more specialised analytical modules and is essential for students wishing to undertake quantitative geospatial research. Ultimately, this module will provide quantitative skills that are in high demand across public, private, and academic sectors."
