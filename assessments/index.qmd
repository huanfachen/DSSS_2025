## Overview

This individual assignment aims to test your ability to conduct in-depth spatial data analysis using methods from this module. You are required to submit a single Python Notebook which contains both the code required to conduct the data analysis and accompanying text which provides context and interpretation.

## Assessment Steps

### 1. Select a Main Dataset

You are recommended to choose one of the following datasets and define a research question that relates to **urban or spatial processes**. Feel free to use a subset of the chosen dataset, such as focusing on a specific crime type or a type of traffic incidents.

If you wish to use a different dataset, you are welcome to do so, as long as the dataset is relevant to urban or spatial processes and is appropriate for the analysis.

| Dataset | Link | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **London Crime Records** | [data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary) | Crime data across London |
| **Childhood Obesity Prevalence** | [data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/prevalence-childhood-obesity-borough) | Obesity rates by borough, ward, and MSOA |
| **Road Safety Data (UK)** | [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data) | Incident location, severity, weather, road conditions, vehicle types, etc. |

### 2. Define Your Research Question

Your research question should be specific and clear. Examples:
- "What is the relationship between crime rates and local deprivation in London?"
- "Is it possible to predict childhood obesity prevalence using socio-demographic variables?"
- "How do road accident rates vary by location and weather conditions in the UK?"

### 3. Augment Your Data (Optional)

You can enhance your main dataset with additional datasets from:
- Census and demographic data
- Social indicators
- Economic factors
- Environmental variables

### 4. Structure Your Analysis

You need to use the [notebook template](Template_submission_CASA0006.ipynb) for this assessment. 

The analysis should be captured in a **single Python notebook** containing:
- All code for data analysis
- Full documentation of the analysis process
- Interpretation of results
- Narrative text (max 1500 words, code/comments not included)

### 5. Choose Your Methods

You can use *up to 4 methods* that are appropriate for your research question.

### 6. Include Required Notebook Sections

Your notebook must include these sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Include at least 3 relevant studies from credible sources (Google Scholar, CrossRef, etc.)
   - Set the context for your research

2. **Research Questions**
   - State explicitly, ending with a question mark
   - Example: "What is the relationship between Covid-19 mortality rate and local deprivation in the UK?"

3. **Data**
   - Describe your datasets
   - Explain any preprocessing or cleaning

4. **Methodology**
   - Explain the methods you chose and why
   - Connect them to your research question

5. **Results and Discussion**
   - Present findings clearly
   - Interpret results in context

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summarise key findings
   - Discuss implications

7. **References**
   - Use credible sources only

## Marking Scheme

Your work will be assessed across these categories:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Analysis context and research questions | 15% |
| Data collection, handling, and presentation | 15% |
| Correctness, depth, and scope of data analysis | 35% |
| Visualisation | 10% |
| Quality of writing | 15% |
| Creativity of analytical work | 10% |

A more details marking scheme is below:

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("CASA0006_mark_scheme.csv", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
display(Markdown(df.to_markdown()))
```

---

## Key Considerations

### 1. Use Rate, Not Count

In most analysis, **rate is more appropriate than count** because it normalises data by accounting for population size or scale.

**Example:** In road safety research, calculate the rate of traffic incidents by normalising the count of incidents by traffic volume or population size.

### 2. Use Credible References

- References must be relevant and credible (Google Scholar, CrossRef)
- **Do not use** unverified references generated by LLM - this is BAD ACADEMIC PRACTICE and will be penalised

### 3. Choose Methods Wisely

- Ensure all methods are directly relevant to your research question
- Avoid including irrelevant or excessive methods; this reduces submission quality

---

## Major Problems to Avoid

A high-quality submission (distinction/merit level) should NOT contain these issues:

1. ❌ **ID Columns** - Including identification columns for analysis without justification
2. ❌ **Categorical as Numerical** - Treating categorical variables as numerical ones incorrectly
3. ❌ **Code-Discussion Mismatch** - Inconsistency between code results and discussion (e.g. model accuracy differs)
4. ❌ **Code Errors** - Code in the notebook is not run or contains errors
5. ❌ **Notebook-PDF Mismatch** - Python notebook and PDF file are largely different
6. ❌ **Excess printing dataframe** - Printing large dataframes frequently or after each step is not necessary

---

## Submission

The deadline for the assessment is {{< var assess.deadline-date >}} \@ {{< var assess.deadline-time >}}.

### What to Submit

**Part 1:** Python notebook (or .zip file with notebook + dataset files)  
**Part 2:** PDF file exported from the notebook

Submit **both parts separately** in two tabs on Moodle. The submission timestamp is based on the later of the two parts.

### Critical Rules

**You will receive a mark of 0 if:**

- You fail to submit either Part 1 or Part 2
- The content of Part 2 is largely different from Part 1

### Dataset Requirements

- Share your dataset in a **GitHub repository** and remotely read it in the notebook (e.g. using `read_csv`)
- If data size exceeds 100 MB (GitHub limit), submit a .zip file with the notebook and data

### Library Requirements

- If possible, use only libraries from the **recommended computing environment** (Podman/Docker/Anaconda)
- If you must use other libraries (including fastai):
  - Clearly state the library names and version numbers

### Execution Requirements

- **Notebook must execute within 1 hour** at submission; please remove unnecessary coding from the notebook
- Use Jupyter's 'Restart & Rerun all' before submission to verify viability
- If data preprocessing requires significant time, you may provide preprocessed data with a detailed description

::: {.callout-warning}
Penalty will apply if the code is not run or results contain errors or are not clearly presented.

## Exporting to PDF

### Steps to Export

1. In the web browser running your notebook, right-click
2. Select **'Print'**
3. In the printer dialog, select **'Save as PDF'**
4. Choose your save location

**Alternative methods** are acceptable as long as the PDF is **text-selectable**.

### Moodle Warning

You may see a warning about supported file types when uploading your notebook (see below). You can **safely ignore this**.

```
You must upload a supported file type for this assignment. 

Accepted file types are; .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .pdf, .txt, .htm, .html, .hwp, .odt, .wpd, .ps and .rtf
```
