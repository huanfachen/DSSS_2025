The *Data Science for Spatial Systems* (DSSS, CASA0006) module is a optional element of CASA's [MSc/MRes USS Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/study) and is intended provide an introduction to advanced computational techniques in spatial analysis, or advanced spatial data sicence.

As with most computational analysis, spatial data science builds on two pillars: methods and data. In recent year, as AI (represented by deep learning and large-language models) has developed rapidly, various computational techniques have been invented and deployed, which enables complicated analysis of large-scale and heterougenous data. For example, we are now able to combine census data, remote sensing data, street-view imagery, and text data for understanding *urban security* or *urban heat island effect* on a laptop. Notably, (geospatial) foundation models, which are large, pre-trained AI models, are expected to become versatile bases for many diffferent tasks. It seems like we could model and predict almost everything in spatial analysis, even if we don't understand what foundation models are doing. However, this is not entirely true. So far, AI is not yet silver bullet and AI produces halluciations. We need to understand the principle and limitations of various computational models; we need to be critical about methods and results; we need to ask critical questions for any task; and we need to link modelling with applications so as to inform policy and practice.

This module aims to provide students with a solid foundation in (geospatial) machine learning, focusing on supervised learning techniques and their applications to real-world problems. We acknowledge that this is not a full coverage of machine learning or data science, but we believe that mastering supervised learning is the natural foundation and crucial step for students to embark on their journey in (spatial) data science.

The module is structured progressively across three core parts. The first part (W1-3) introduces machinea learning (in general) and the metrics/workflow of supervised learning. The second part (W4-6) covers three two key types of supervised learning and their derivatives, including tree-based methods and neural networks. The third part (W7-10) focuses on advanced topics and applications, including model interpretation and feature selection, handling imbalanced data, machine learning operations (MLOps), and testing of machine learning systems.
